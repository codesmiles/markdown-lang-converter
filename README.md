# MD-LANG-CONVERTER

## Idea

Implement an api that accept a file of texts of any language and converts it into a different one preferrable english.

process
// express-file-upload to receive incoming md file request
// fs module to save the file in a public folder,access the data in the files, create files for the translate files
// google translations for interpreting data
// fs to return either all the response in text or in an md document downloadable format or as a link
// tests for endpoint created
// readme doc for what's being done or what we're about to do
